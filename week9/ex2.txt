If the sqeuence comatins many same refs, it will increase Hit cases, so the ratio will increase. And if all refs are the same, the ratio will tend to maximum. 
The worst ratio we will get when all refs are distinct.

As a result, we should use as many same-page references as possible to increase the ratio.
